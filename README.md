Jackhammer Project
==================

Introduction
============

Jackhammer is a Laravel 5.1 project that is heavily opinionated in terms of mass creating
a lot of boilerplate code for RESTful controllers, admin section, repositories, models,
transformers, routes, etc. In short, it does a vast majority of boring work so you won't have to.

Currently, the framework only supports Mysql and InnoDB. Hopefully, in the future, the framework
will expand to support other databases and potentially nosql types. In addition, only Redis caching
is supported at this stage and again hopefully, more forms of caching will be supported in the future.
