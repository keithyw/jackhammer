Jackhammer Project
==================

Introduction
============

Jackhammer is a Laravel 5.1 project that is heavily opinionated in terms of mass creating
a lot of boilerplate code for RESTful controllers, admin section, repositories, models,
transformers, routes, etc. In short, it does a vast majority of boring work so you won't have to.

Currently, the framework only supports Mysql and InnoDB. Hopefully, in the future, the framework
will expand to support other databases and potentially nosql types. In addition, only Redis caching
is supported at this stage and again hopefully, more forms of caching will be supported in the future.

Configuration
=============

jackhammer.php is the primary configuration file for managing the system.

Future Enhancements
===================

* Support for other RDBMS types
* Support for Nosql storage
* Support for non-Redis caching
* Model validation
* Form request validation
* Resource based authorization
* File upload management
* Image upload management
